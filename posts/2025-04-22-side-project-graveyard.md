## TL;DR
- 12 unfinished projects in 3 years
- Each failure taught me something valuable
- Shipping > perfection

## Context

My GitHub is full of repos with grand names and 3 commits. Each one started with excitement and ended with "I'll finish it later" (narrator: he didn't).

## Main

### Project #1: The Todo App (Obviously)

Every developer's first side project. Mine had user auth, tags, categories, themes, and an API. I spent 3 weeks on the auth system alone. Never shipped.

**Lesson:** Start with the core feature. Auth can come later.

### Project #7: The Blog Engine

Why use existing blog platforms when I could build my own? Custom markdown parser, comment system, analytics... I got lost in features nobody asked for.

**Lesson:** Use existing tools. Focus on content, not infrastructure.

### Project #12: The SaaS Idea

This was going to be THE ONE. Six months of planning, tech stack decisions, and database schema design. Zero users.

**Lesson:** Talk to potential users before writing code.

### The Pattern

I was building for myself, not for users. I was optimizing for learning, not shipping. Both are fine, but I wasn't honest about which one I was doing.

## Takeaways

- Define success before starting
- Time-box side projects
- Ship ugly MVPs
- It's okay to abandon projects
- The graveyard is a learning ground
