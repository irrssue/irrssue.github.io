## TL;DR
- Respect user's system preference
- Use CSS variables for easy switching
- Test in actual dark environments

## Context

I added dark mode to my site by making the background black and text white. It looked terrible. Users complained about eye strain and poor contrast.

## Main

### System Preferences First

Dark mode should respect `prefers-color-scheme`. Let users choose, but default to their system setting. Don't force your preference on them.

### Not Just Black and White

True black (#000) on OLED screens causes smearing. I use `#1a1a1a` instead. Pure white text is harsh - `#e0e0e0` is easier on the eyes.

### The Details Matter

- Code blocks need different backgrounds in each mode
- Link colors need adjustment for contrast
- Border colors that work in light mode disappear in dark
- Images might need borders or background colors

### CSS Variables Save Time

```css
:root {
  --bg-color: #ffffff;
  --text-color: #1a1a1a;
}

[data-theme="dark"] {
  --bg-color: #1a1a1a;
  --text-color: #e0e0e0;
}
```

One toggle, everything updates.

## Takeaways

- Test your dark mode at night with the lights off
- Ask for feedback from actual users
- Don't just invert - redesign
- Save the user's preference in localStorage
