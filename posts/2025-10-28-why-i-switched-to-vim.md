## TL;DR
- Modal editing is a game changer for productivity
- No more reaching for the mouse
- Customization possibilities are endless

## Context

I spent five years using VS Code as my primary editor. It was comfortable, had great extensions, and everyone around me used it. But I kept hearing about Vim from developers I respected, and I was curious.

## Main

The learning curve was steep. For the first week, my productivity dropped by 50%. I had a cheat sheet taped to my monitor and constantly googled basic commands. But something clicked in week two.

### The Modal Magic

The concept of modes (normal, insert, visual) felt weird at first. Why would I want to switch modes just to delete text? But once muscle memory kicked in, I realized how powerful it was. I could navigate and edit code without ever touching the mouse.

### Speed Over Time

Now, three months in, I'm faster than I ever was in VS Code. The combination of motions (`ciw`, `dap`, `%`) and plugins has transformed how I code. My hands stay on the home row, and my workflow is pure keyboard.

### Worth the Investment

Is Vim for everyone? Probably not. But if you're willing to invest the time upfront, the payoff is real. I'm more productive, my wrists hurt less, and coding feels more fluid.

## Takeaways

- Start with basic motions and gradually add more
- Use vimtutor - it's actually helpful
- Don't try to configure everything at once
- Give it at least two weeks before deciding
