## TL;DR
- "A Philosophy of Software Design" - changed my approach to abstractions
- "The Pragmatic Programmer" - still relevant after 25 years
- "Designing Data-Intensive Applications" - deep but worth it

## Context

I used to only read blog posts and documentation. Books felt too slow. But I realized I was learning scattered facts without deep understanding.

## Main

### A Philosophy of Software Design

John Ousterhout's book is short but dense. The main idea: complexity is incremental. Every decision either reduces or increases it. This simple framework changed how I review code.

### The Pragmatic Programmer

Originally published in 1999, updated in 2019. The principles still hold:
- DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Orthogonality
- Reversibility
- Tracer bullets over prototypes

Age doesn't matter when fundamentals are solid.

### Designing Data-Intensive Applications

Martin Kleppmann's masterpiece. It's dense and technical, but explains distributed systems better than anything else I've read. Took me three months to finish.

### The Pattern

The best technical books aren't tutorials. They're frameworks for thinking. They don't teach you React or Python - they teach you how to approach problems.

## Takeaways

- Read books, not just articles
- Take notes and revisit them
- One great book > ten mediocre ones
- Apply concepts immediately to solidify learning
