## TL;DR
- Removed 90% of VS Code extensions
- Terminal-based workflow with tmux
- Focused tools that do one thing well

## Context

My VS Code had 47 extensions. My terminal had 23 custom aliases. My dotfiles repo was 5000 lines. I spent more time configuring tools than using them.

## Main

I decided to start fresh. Deleted all extensions, removed all aliases, and used only the basics for one week.

### What Stayed

After the detox, I added back only what I truly missed:
- Vim motions (can't live without it)
- Git integration
- Language server for autocomplete
- One color theme

That's it. Four extensions instead of 47.

### Terminal Over GUI

I moved most tasks to the terminal. Git commands instead of clicking. Tmux sessions instead of tabs. It felt slower at first, but the muscle memory built up quickly.

### The Benefits

Less context switching. Fewer distractions. Faster startup time. And weirdly, I feel more in control of my environment.

## Takeaways

- Question every tool you use regularly
- Minimal doesn't mean primitive
- Learn the fundamentals before adding abstractions
- Your future self will thank you
