## TL;DR
- Morning coffee ritual = better focus
- Pour-over as meditation before coding
- Caffeine timing matters for productivity

## Context

I used to grab instant coffee while checking emails, multitasking from the moment I woke up. My code quality before 10 AM was questionable at best.

## Main

### The Ritual

I started making pour-over coffee every morning. Not because I'm a snob, but because it forces me to slow down. Four minutes of just coffee and thoughts before touching my laptop.

### Better Mornings

This simple ritual changed my mornings. I arrive at my desk calm and focused instead of frazzled and reactive. My best code now happens between 8-10 AM.

### The Science

I learned that caffeine takes 20 minutes to kick in. So I drink coffee, then do light tasks (email, planning) while it kicks in. By the time I start coding, I'm in peak focus mode.

## Takeaways

- Build rituals around important activities
- Slow down to speed up
- Good coffee is worth it
- Mindfulness > multitasking
